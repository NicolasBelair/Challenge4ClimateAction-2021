"Note: Only the introduction or removal of an ETS or carbon tax is shown. The coverage of each carbon pricing initiative is presented as a share of annual global GHG emissions for 1990-2015 based on data from the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) version 5.0 including biofuels emissions. From 2015 onwards, the share of global GHG emissions is based on 2015 emissions from EDGAR. The GHG emissions coverage for each jurisdiction is based on official government sources and/or estimates.  If emissions that are covered by multiple carbon pricing initiatives shown in the graph, these are attributed to the carbon pricing initiative that was introduced first. Due to the dynamic approach to continuously improve data quality, changes to the graph do not only reflect new developments, but also corrections following new information from official government sources.  The information on the China national ETS represents early unofficial estimates based on the announcement of China’s National Development and Reform Commission on the launch of the national ETS of December 2017.
