"Note: Carbon pricing initiatives are considered ""scheduled for implementation"" once they have been formally adopted through legislation and have an official, planned start date.  Carbon pricing initiatives are considered “under consideration” if the government has announced its intention to work towards the implementation of a carbon pricing initiative and this has been formally confirmed by official government sources.  Jurisdictions that only mention carbon pricing in their NDCs are not included as different interpretations of the NDC text are possible. The carbon pricing initiatives have been classified in ETSs and carbon taxes according to how they operate technically. ETS does not only refer to cap-and-trade systems, but also baseline-and-credit systems such as in British Columbia and baseline-and-offset systems such as in Australia. Carbon pricing has evolved over the years and initiatives do not necessarily follow the two categories in a strict sense. Due to the dynamic approach to continuously improve data quality, changes to the map do not only reflect new developments, but also corrections following new information from official government sources.    ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
