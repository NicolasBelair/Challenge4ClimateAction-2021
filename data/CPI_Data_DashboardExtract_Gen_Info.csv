Under the new system, electricity must continue to meet a clean-as-best gas benchmark while the emissions performance benchmark that other industrial facilities need to meet can now also be based on 90% of their past performance instead of only a sector-wide benchmark under the CCIR. Facility-specific benchmarks will reduce by 1% annually beginning in 2021. Facilities can meet their benchmark by reducing emissions, purchasing performance credits from other facilities, using Alberta-based emission offsets or paying into a TIER compliance fund at CAN$30/tCO2e (US$21/tCO2e), a price consistent with the federal minimum carbon price for 2020.

Facilities can choose to use facility-specific emissions intensity benchmarks or sector-wide benchmarks. Facility-specific benchmarks are based on 90% of their past performance and will reduce by 1% annually beginning in 2021. Operators can earn emissions performance credits if their emission intensity is below the benchmark level, and sell these credits to other covered operators or bank them for future compliance cycles.

BC carbon tax,Carbon tax,Implemented,2008,The British Columbia carbon tax (official name: B.C.'s Revenue Neutral Carbon Tax) aims to encourage people and businesses to innovate and find the most cost-efficient methods of reducing emissions to pay less in carbon tax. Revenue neutral means that the carbon tax revenue is recycled back into the economy through various income tax reductions and tax credits.,"The British Columbia (BC) carbon tax was scheduled to increase from CAN$40/tCO2e to CAN$45/tCO2e (US$28/tCO2e to US$32/tCO2e) on April 1, 2020 and continue to increase annually by CAN$5/tCO2e (US$4/tCO2e) until the rate is CAN$50/tCO2e (US$35/tCO2e) in 2021. In following this schedule, BC would achieve the rate of CAN$50/tCO2e (US$35/tCO2e) one year before the federal fuel charge. However, in response to COVID-19, the rate was frozen at CAN$40/tCO2e (US$28/tCO2e) until further notice.  As an additional response to COVID-19, the BC climate action tax credit, a measure to help offset the impact of the carbon tax on households, will be increased and expanded in July 2020 to provide income support for BC residents.  The CleanBC Industrial Incentive Program (CIIP) was established in 2019 for large industrial facilities that must report their emissions under the Greenhouse Gas Industrial Reporting and Control Act (GGIRCA). It provides payments to industrial facilities based on their emission performance (i.e. a comparison against emissions intensity benchmarks) to offset the carbon tax cost that they face above CAN$30/tCO2e.

China national ETS,ETS,Scheduled,2021,"On December 19, 2017, China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) officially launched the national ETS. Building on its experience of successfully piloting carbon markets since 2013, the national ETS' objective is to contribute to the effective control and gradual reduction of carbon emissions in China and the achievement of green and low carbon development.  Accompanying the announcement of the launch of the China ETS in December 2017 was the release of a work plan outlining targets and the roadmap to develop the national ETS. The ETS roadmap consists of two phases: infrastructure development and simulated trading, and deepening and expanding. The infrastructure development phase is focused on completing the legal foundation and market support systems for the China national ETS, including the trading platform, registry, and data reporting systems. In the final deepening and expanding phase, the power sector will be the first sector to have compliance obligations under the ETS, which can be met by trading allowances on the spot market. ","China is curently working on the national ETS market infrastructure development. Construction and operation of the registry and trading platform are led by Hubei and Shanghai respectively, under the supervision of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE). The systems have now been developed and are under review. In late August, the MEE circulated an updated version of the draft allocation plan for the power sector, building on the trial plan released last year. The document was sent for consultation among key stakeholders with input due by the end of August 2020. It provides details of the allocation methods and benchmark values; allowance issuance and surrendering; price stability measures; a list of covered entities; provisions for closure, merger, or separation of plants; and plants covered by the regional ETS pilots, among other topics. On September 27, the MEE held a news conference arguing that key industries such as steel and cement will be brought into the ETS in the ""14th five-year plan"". On October 26, the MEE and other five departments jointly issued a document stating that financial institutions and individuals in line with the trading rules should be added to participate in the national ETS.  On October 28, 2020, the General Office of the MEE issued two further policy documents on the national ETS establishing regulatory authority and specifying general rules in key areas of market operation and design. The two documents, entitled “The National Measures for the Administration of Carbon Emission Trading (Trial)” and “The Administrative Measures for the Registration, Trading, and Settlement of the National Carbon Emission Rights (Trial)” are now under public consultation until the beginning of December 2020. The National Measures aim to provide the legal basis for the upcoming national system and supersede interim measures published in 2014. The second document applies to allowances rather than offset credits, clarifying the basic elements and oversight system of emission allowance registration, trading, and settlement, as well as the functions of the responsible agencies.    ",China,13235 MtCO2e,26%,"The ETS will initially only apply to CO2 emissions from the power sector, including combined heat and power and captive power plants from other sectors.

EU ETS,ETS,Implemented,2005,"The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) represents the central pillar of the EU climate change policy and is the oldest and largest ETS for GHGs operating worldwide. Introduced in 2005 and now in its third phase, the system has gone through several reforms and will change again with the start of phase 4 in January 2021. ","As part of the EU's Green Deal in line with the EU's commitment to reach carbon-neutrality by 2050, as enshrined in the proposed European climate law, the Commission will review and propose to revise where necessary all relevant climate-related policy instruments by June 2021. In September 2020, the European Commission presented its plan to ramp up climate ambition towards 2030, proposing to cut emissions by at least 55% compared to 1990 levels. The 2030 Climate Target Plan is based on the Commission’s impact assessment  and comes with policy options to reach the higher reduction goal. Proposed revisions to the ETS include an expansion of the system’s scope to include emissions from the transport and buildings sectors through upstream coverage, a steeper reduction in the cap trajectory as well as a potential one-off reduction to the cap. While the share of free allocation would be revised downwards, industries at high risk of carbon leakage would continue to receive support through this mechanism under the new target. Alternative options to address leakage risks, including a carbon border adjustment targeting specific industrial sectors, are also considered in the Climate Target Plan.  Although not explicitly stated in the document, revisions to the MSR may also be expected as part of the planned review in 2021. The policy options are to be presented as legislative proposals by June 2021. The European Parliament has backed the Commission’s plan while adopting a more stringent emission reduction target of 60% in early October 2020.   Following its departure from the EU on January 31, 2020, the UK effectively also withdrew from the EU ETS. However, during the transition period until the end of 2020, the UK still participates in the EU ETS, and UK installations will therefore continue to face compliance obligations for their 2019 and 2020 emissions. In early February 2020, the European Commission published a negotiating mandate to begin talks with the UK on a deal governing post-Brexit relations. The mandate encourages the Parties to consider linking a UK national ETS with the EU ETS.  Linking would need to be based on conditions agreed within the EU to ensure a level playing field and the integrity of the EU ETS. After the end of the transition period, emissions from stationary installations in the UK fall outside the scope of the EU ETS and Union law. Flights between the UK and EU will remain within the scope of the EU ETS following a derogation (Article 28a) in the EU ETS Directive. Operators located or based in the United Kingdom that want to continue holding EUAs beyond April 30, 2021 would have to open a trading account in the Union Registry administered by an EU Member State and move their assets accordingly. Financial firms and institutions wanting to continue their participation in EU ETS auctions beyond this date should ensure that they are established as a legal entity in the EU.   The link between the registries of the Swiss and EU emissions trading systems that will enable the transfer of allowances, initially postponed due to COVID-19, became operational as of September 21, 2020 on a provisional basis. Transfers between the registries are executed on pre-announced dates that are released at least one month in advance.

In 2026, auctions will be introduced alongside a price corridor between EUR55/tCO2e (US$60/tCO2e) and EUR65/tCO2e (US$71/tCO2e). Whether a price corridor should be applied for 2027 onwards will be decided in 2025 based on a review of the system. These prices are higher than the initial prices in the adopted Fuel Emissions Trading Act that started at EUR10/tCO2e (US$11/tCO2e) in 2021. The increased prices are a result of negotiations between federal level and state governments in Germany.

Netherlands carbon tax,Carbon tax,Under consideration,TBC,"In June 2019, the Netherlands government presented a National Climate Agreement, which included the support for further strengthening of the EU ETS and also contains two measures of national carbon pricing. In the climate agreement a carbon price floor for electricity generators covered under the EU ETS is agreed upon, including facilities in the power sector and electricity generators, including those in the industry sector. The carbon price floor aims to provide long-term certainty on the carbon costs electricity producers face and to ensure these costs are considered in investment decisions.  If EUA prices are below the carbon floor price, covered facilities will be required to pay the difference between the two in the form of a tax, in addition to meeting their compliance obligations under the EU ETS.    The Dutch government also announced the details of a carbon tax for industry starting in 2021 in the National Climate Agreement.  The carbon tax would target all Dutch installations subject to the EU ETS, as well as waste incinerators currently not included in the EU ETS to provide them with a stronger incentive to reduce their emissions.  Installations would only have to pay the carbon tax if their emissions exceed their baseline based on benchmarks and a national reduction factor needed to reach the Dutch targets for the industry. The carbon tax comes on top of their compliance obligations in the EU ETS. The benchmarks will be based on the EU ETS free allocation benchmarks. Covered installations can also cooperate to reduce their emissions below their designated baseline. Revenues from the industry carbon tax would be earmarked to finance green industrial activities. ","The carbon floor price for electricity generator would be set at EUR12.3/tCO2 (US$15/tCO2e) in 2020, rising to EUR31.9/tCO2 (US$39/tCO2e) in 2030. With EUA prices around EUR20-25/tCO2e (US$22-27/tCO2e) in 2019 and projections used for establishing the floor price rates, the government expects electricity generators will not face any carbon costs from the floor price in the first few years of its implementation.  The bill for the carbon price floor is still in the legislative process, and if passed, it will enter into force a day after the final version has been officially published.    The level of the carbon tax for industry is to be determined, but according to initial estimates the tax would start at EUR30/tCO2 (US$33/tCO2e) and would rise to EUR125-150/tCO2 (US$137-164/tCO2e) in 2030.

New Zealand ETS,ETS,Implemented,2008,"The New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS) is New Zealand's principle policy response to climate change. Originally designed to cover the whole economy, it has the broadest sectoral coverage of any ETS by directly covering forestry, waste and liquid fossil fuels, as well as power and industry. The NZ ETS was originally conceived as a nested system under the Kyoto Protocol, with full links to international carbon markets. However, as of 1 June 2015, the NZ ETS became a domestic-only system. As indicated by New Zealand's NDC, re-establishing a link to high-integrity international carbon markets will form part of New Zealand's strategy for meeting its 2030 target.","On June 16, 2020, the New Zealand government completed comprehensive legislative reforms, strengthening the NZ ETS and aligning it with national emissions targets and long-term net-zero goals. After the passing of the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Reform and Zero Carbon) Amendment Acts, the government further announced regulatory settings for the NZ ETS from 2021-2025, which will establish a cap on emissions for the first time under the NZ ETS.In addition, the government has decided to phase-out free allocations for the industrial sector, at a rate of 1% per year between 2021 and 2030, increasing to 2% in 2030-2040 and 3% in 2040-2050.  Looking ahead, in early 2021, auctioning is to be introduced to the NZ ETS, and the reforms  provide for a cost containment reserve as a price ceiling and an auction reserve price as a price floor, hereby setting up a price corridor for the auctioning of units. In addition, the forestry sector is undergoing a raft of reforms, including simplified accounting measures (e.g. averaging) for new entrants.  Furthermore, the New Zealand government will put a price on GHG emissions from the agricultural sector, beginning in 2025. Agricultural GHG emissions, particularly from livestock are to be covered preferably at the farm level by levy/rebate system - a separate alternative pricing mechanism to the NZ ETS.  A partnership between the government and the agricultural sector, called ‘He Waka Eke Noa’, has been established to prepare for this pricing mechanism, including the development of on-farm accounting and reporting systems for GHG sources and sinks. However, if this partnership has not made enough progress by 2022 for implementation in 2025, then livestock emissions may be brought directly into the NZ ETS and priced at the processor level (e.g. milk processors). GHG emissions from fertilizers are likely to be covered upstream under the NZ ETS at the manufacturer level.",New Zealand,89 MtCO2e,51%,"The NZ ETS applies to GHG emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, HFCs and PFCs) from the industry, power, waste, transport and forestry sectors and includes industrial process emissions.

The NZ ETS will have its own fixed cap in the future.","Emission allowances are distributed via free allocation for industrial sectors on the basis of benchmarks and actual production activity data.

The regulation is currently going through a 60-day public comment period until January 14, 2021 followed by the state’s regulatory review process before a final proposal can be adopted in 2021. The state legislature tried to block the implementation of the ETS regulation and the RGGI linkage with bill HG-2025 by requiring legislative approval for any regional carbon pricing initiative initiated by the state government, but this bill was vetoed by the governor. The earliest start date for Pennsylvania's ETS and its linkage to RGGI is envisaged to be 2022.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Climate Change Regulation,,

Washington CAR,ETS,Implemented,2017,"The Clean Air Rule (CAR) in the US state Washington was launched in 2017, establishing a baseline-and-credit system. The Washington CAR aims to reduce carbon emissions to do the state's part to help slow climate change.","The state suspended compliance requirements under the CAR after a county court ruling on December 15, 2017 found that the Department of Ecology did not have the authority to cover suppliers of natural gas and petroleum products under its ETS because they are not direct emitters of GHGs. On January 16, 2020, the Washington Supreme Court partially upheld the CAR. This new ruling stated that the compliance requirements could apply to stationary sources of direct emissions but not to fuel suppliers and natural gas distributors that indirectly emit GHGs from combustion occurring farther downstream.  The CAR now has to go back to the county court to determine how to separate the rule.  At the same time, bills were submitted to the Washington State legislature at the request of the governor to extend the Department of Ecology's authority to regulate indirect sources of emissions such as fuel suppliers and natural gas distributors. These failed to pass during the 2020 legislative session.",Washington,97 MtCO2e,67%,"The Washington CAR applies to GHG emissions from the industry, power, transport, waste and buildings sectors, and include industrial process emissions.",Not applicable,The total emission limit under the Washington CAR is the bottom-up combination of the absolute emission baseline for each covered facility.,"The emissions intensity baseline (emission limit) of each facility is based on their GHG emission intensity. Operators can earn credits if their emission intensity is below the baseline level, and sell these credits to other covered operators or bank them for future compliance. For new entrants that are not energy intensive nor trade exposed, benchmarks can be used to determine their emissions intensity baseline.","Operators do not have to pay for GHG emission up to their baseline emission intensity level. Only if the baseline emissions intensity level is exceeded, operators must surrender a number of compliance units (See Point of regulation). In 2017, it only covers installations with baseline GHG emissions greater than 100 ktCO2e that are not considered to be energy intensive nor trade exposed. Every three years, the inclusion threshold is lowered by 5 ktCO2e and from 2020 energy intensive and trade exposed sectors and fuel importers are also included in the Washington CAR.","Industry operators are liable for reporting their covered emissions at a facility level. For transport and buildings sector, the importer or producer of transport fuels and distributor of natural gas is liable. All liable entities need to surrender an equivalent amount of emission allowances (and eligible offsets).",The compliance cycle is based on a three-year compliance period. Operators have to submit their emissions reports on an annual basis and need to meet their compliance obligations at the end of the three year compliance period.,Operators can use eligible offsets to meet up to their compliance obligation. Only offsets generated in Washington according to an approved offset protocol are eligible.,N/A,Not applicable,Not applicable,N/A,N/A,Operations can use emission units from approved ETSs outside Washington state to meet their compliance obligations.

Zacatecas carbon tax,Carbon tax,Implemented,2017,"In January 2017, the Mexican state Zacatecas enacted a carbon tax as part of a broader fiscal reform which included the introduction of various ecological taxes.  The carbon tax rate was set at MXN250 per tCO2e. The carbon tax applies to fixed sources and facilities. Revenues are used for different purposes, including social programmes and for the creation of climate change funds.","Following the introduction of the ecological taxes in Zacatecas in 2017, the Mexican government filed a courtcase against the state of Zacacetas arguing that only federal authorities have the power to introduce ecological taxes. However, in April 2019, the Mexican Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state of Zacatecas.",Zacatecas,0 MtCO2e,N/A,The Zacacetas carbon tax applies to GHG emissions from all sectors.
